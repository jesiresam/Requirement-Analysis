Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Requirement Analysis
What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs of stakeholders to define the functionalities and constraints of a system. It ensures that the software being developed addresses real user needs and aligns with business goals.

In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis serves as the foundation for design, development, and testing, helping prevent costly rework and misunderstandings later.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC because:

Clarity and Alignment

Ensures all stakeholders share a common understanding of system requirements.

Reduces ambiguity and misinterpretation.

Cost and Time Efficiency

Identifies issues early in the project lifecycle, saving time and money.

Prevents rework caused by missing or misunderstood requirements.

Quality Assurance

Provides a baseline for creating test cases.

Helps ensure the final product meets user needs and expectations.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Gathering
Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observations, and existing documentation.

Requirement Elicitation
Engaging stakeholders to uncover both stated and hidden requirements. Techniques include brainstorming, workshops, and prototyping.

Requirement Documentation
Writing clear and structured requirement specifications (e.g., SRS documents).

Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Analyzing feasibility, conflicts, and dependencies among requirements. Modeling tools like use case diagrams or data flow diagrams may be used.

Requirement Validation
Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, completeness, and feasibility.

Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do—the features and functionality.

Examples for Booking Management System:

Users can search for available rooms by date and type.

The system allows customers to book a room and receive confirmation.

Admins can add, update, or remove room listings.

Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system performs its functions—quality attributes and constraints.

Examples for Booking Management System:

The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users without performance degradation.

Response time for room search should not exceed 2 seconds.

The platform should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interaction between actors (users or external systems) and the system. They help clarify functional requirements and show system boundaries.

Benefits:

Easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Provides a high-level overview of system functionality.

Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that must be met for a feature to be accepted by stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story and ensure requirements are testable and verifiable.

Importance:

Ensures clarity on what “done” means.

Guides developers and testers with measurable conditions.

Reduces risk of scope creep and miscommunication.

Example — Checkout Feature (Booking System):

Given a customer has selected a room and entered payment details,

When they click “Confirm Booking,”

Then the system should process payment securely,

And display a booking confirmation with reservation details.
